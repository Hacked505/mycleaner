Usage: mycleaner.py [OPTIONS]

  My Cleaner - CLI utility for destroying, zeroing, and deleting files.

Options:
  --paths, --p TEXT   Paths to a files or folder with files, all attached
                      files and folders will be taken into account! Be
                      extremely careful and attentive when adding.
                      
  --num, --n INTEGER  Number of overwrites. If you use the shred method, each
                      file will be overwritten the specified number of times
                      before being destroyed.
                      
  --dirs, --d         Delete the folders?
  
  --yes, --y          Auto Mode, be very careful with this parameter, if you
                      specify it, the program will start and start destroying
                      files automatically.
                      
  --shred             Overwrites random data, renames and deletes the file,
                      used by default.
                      
  --zero              Resets and does not delete the file.
  
  --del               Resets and deletes the file.
  
  --version, --v      Displays the version of the program and exits.
