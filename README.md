Description:

>A package of modules and console utilities for destroying, 
> zeroing, and deleting files.

>With this package, you can develop graphical, 
> console , and cross-platform applications to destroy, 
> reset data in a file, and delete files 
> so that they are difficult or impossible to recover. 
> 
>You can also use a ready-made console utility for destruction, 
> reset and delete files, as well as use the graphical utility 
> developed using the mycleaner and pyside2 package.
> 
>Console utility for destruction,
> zeroing, and deleting files.
>
>The utility allows you to destruct files, 
> reset them to zero and delete them, 
> for complete or partial difficulty in 
> restoring them after deletion.
> 
> >Be careful! When adding folders, all files from all subfolders 
will be added recursively.
> 
> >When you run the program with all the parameters, 
> all files located at the specified path will be destroyed, 
> including those nested in other folders,
> if you specify all the arguments, then after 
> starting the utility will start working without 
> confirmation, so be very careful!
> 
> The utility can be run with or without command 
> line arguments to allow you to select the desired parameters manually.
> 
> Run the utility without arguments and follow the instructions below.
> 
> To run the utility with arguments, 
> if you specify all the arguments, then after 
> starting the utility will start working without confirmation, 
> so be very careful! If you do not specify 
> one of the important arguments such as the path, 
> the number of mashing or the method to work with, 
> the utility will start, but will prompt you to enter 
> the necessary parameters.
